Our project, [VisBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIunloIPr_Y) - a Project for the Westpac Innovation and Coding Competition was awarded 2nd place for innovation and creativity. In collaboration with Yanzhuo Yang, Kelly Hou, Thisura Senarath and Hongyi Tao.
VisBank is a mixed reality (MR) platform that aims to transform abstract banking information into immersive and engaging visualisations that closely relate to customersâ€™ 
lived experiences/financial expectations. Together with intuitive interactions and the spatiality of Mixed Reality environments, 
VisBank aims to keep existing users engaged with their financial goals, as well as to help them manage and compare the various banking products offered at WestPac.
