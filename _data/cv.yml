    - title: GestureExplorer&#58; Immersive Visualisation and Exploration of Gesture Data
      institution: Supervisor&#58; Barrett Ens, Max Cordeil
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Sifted through existing literature, summarised, synthesised and assessed the existing visualisation approaches for gesture elicitation study
        - Applied advanced techniques in Unity and VR development, implemented a system for gesture analysis and exploration
        - Established a backend in python to support k-means and mean shift clustering, dimensional reduction with PCA and MDS, calculation of dynamic time warping distance for pattern identification of gesture data
        - Conducted user studies among recruited participants to evaluate the developed visualisations and features and made improvements based on the feedback
        - Proposed a research poster, a research demonstration and a research paper using LaTex and submitted them to top-tier conferences
        - title: The research outcome of this project includes three conference publications listed below&#58;
