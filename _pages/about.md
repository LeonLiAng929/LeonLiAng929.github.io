My name is Ang 'Leon' Li, or '李昂' in Chinese character. I am currently a PhD candidate at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland in Australia. My supervisors are Dr. [Maxime Cordeil](https://sites.google.com/view/cordeil/home), A/Prof. [Gianluca Demartini](https://www.gianlucademartini.net/) and A/Prof. [Stephen Viller](https://itee.uq.edu.au/profile/1871/stephen-viller).

Prior to my PhD candidature at UQ, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Advanced from Monash University with a first-class honour. My honours thesis concerned the Visualisation and Analysis of Gesture Data in Immersive Environments. I had much pleasure of being supervised by Dr. [Barrett Ens](https://barrettens.github.io/) and Dr. [Maxime Cordeil](https://sites.google.com/view/cordeil/home) at Monash University's [Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab (Now the Embodied Visualisation Research Group)](https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/embodied-visualisation).

My research interests revolve around the field of Human-Centred Interaction with a focus on Immersive Analytics. My current research topic explores data visualisation and interaction in augmented/virtual environments to support in-situ and ad-hoc decision-making while the user is in motion.
